1,Which of the following statements are correct?,OOP is an abbreviation of Object Oriented Programming,CLR is an abbreviation of Common Language Runtime,C# is used for C Sharp programming language,All of the above
2,Which of the following statements are correct?,C# was created by Microsoft,C# is an object-oriented programming language,.NET Framework is required to execute C# language,All of the above
3,Which of the following statements are correct?,CLR is the basic and Virtual Machine component of the .NET Framework,CLR is the run-time environment in the .NET Framework,CLR provides remoting and thread management services,CLR provides memory management and robustness services,All of the above
4,Which of the following statements are correct?,Namespaces are used to organize the classes in a .NET project,Class names declared in one namespace will not clash with the same class names declared in another namespace,Other than classes the members of a namespace can be namespaces and interfaces,In C# the full name of the class starts from its namespace name followed by dot(.) operator and the class name,All of the above
5,Access Modifiers are keywords that define the accessibility of a member or a class or a datatype in a C# program. Which of the following is not an access modifier in C#?,public,protected,internal,private,static
6,Access Modifiers are mainly used to restrict unwanted data manipulation by external programs or classes. Which of the following is not an accessibility level in C#?,public protected,private protected,protected,internal,protected internal,None of the above
7,Value (built-in) Types (also called primitive variable types) and Reference (built-in) Types are the two main categories of C# Types. Which of the following statements is not correct about C# Types?,In C# char is a Value Type,In C# string is a Value Type,In C# object is a Reference Type,In C# int is a Value Type,In C# double is a Value Type
8,Casting is the process of converting one data type into another. Implicit casting (automatic conversion) happens when the compiler can perform the conversion automatically between compatible types and where the target type has a larger capacity. Explicit Casting (type casting or forced conversion) is necessary when converting a larger type to a smaller one. Type conversion in C# can be performed using built-in methods. This is generally needed when converting between incompatible types. Which of the following statements is not correct?,Integer to Double is an example of implicit casting,Double to Integer requires explicit casting,Converting a string to an integer requires a Type conversion,Converting a char to an integer requires a Type conversion
9,Which of the following statements are correct?,In C# a string can behave both like a primitive variable or a reference Variable,If you pass a primitive data value as an argument to a method then the default is pass-by-value,If you pass an array of primitives to a method then the default is pass-by-reference,If you pass a string as an argument to a method then it defaults to pass-by-value,All of the above
10,Regular Expressions are used to compare string data to patterns and can also be used to parse string data. Which of the following statements are not correct?,Regular Expressions do not work on datatypes other than strings,Single Character \w matches one digit or letter,Single Character \W matches one digit or capital letter,Single Character \s one whitespace character including tab and newline,Single Character \S any non-whitespace character
11,Which of the following statements are correct?,Inheritance is the mechanism in C# by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class,The class whose features are inherited is known as superclass(or base class or parent class),The class that inherits the other class is known as a subclass(or derived class or extended class or child class), The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods,All of the above
12,Which of the following statements are correct?,The abstract keyword enables you to create classes and class members that are incomplete and must be implemented in a derived class,Classes can be declared as abstract by putting the keyword "abstract" before the class definition,An abstract class cannot be instantiated,An abstract class is to provide a common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share,Methods can be declared as abstract by adding the keyword "abstract" before the return type,All of the above
13,Which of the following statements are correct?,An interface defines a contract,An interface is like a completely abstract class,Any class that implements that contract must provide an implementation of the members defined in the interface,An interface may define a default implementation for members,All of the above
14,Multiple inheritance refers to the ability of a class to inherit from multiple base classes. Which of the following statements are correct?,C# does not support multiple inheritance of classes,C# does support multiple inheritance using interfaces,C# allows a class to extend a single class and optionally multiple interfaces,All of the above
15,Which of the following are correct about an abstract class?,It contains both declaration and definition parts,It contains a constructor,It can contain static members,It can contain different types of access modifiers including private and protected,it can contain methods and fields and constants,All of the above
16,Which of the following are correct about an Interface?,It contains only a declaration part,It does not contain a constructor,It does not contain static members,It only contains public access modifier because everything in the interface is public,It can only contain methods,All of the above
17,Method Overloading is the common way of implementing polymorphism. It is the ability to redefine a function in more than one form. A user can implement function overloading by defining two or more functions in a class sharing the same name. Which of the following are not correct?,Over-loaded methods can have the same name but with different number of parameters list within the same class,Over-loaded methods can have the same name but with a different order of the parameters within the same class,Over-loaded methods can have the same name but with different data types of the parameters within the same class,Overloaded methods are differentiated based on the number and type of the parameters passed as arguments to the methods,Over-loaded methods can have the same signature and different return types within the same class
18,Which of the following statements are correct?,Enumeration (or enum) is a value data type in C#,It is mainly used to assign the names or string values to integral constants,The main purpose of enum is to define our own data types(enumerated),Enumeration is declared using the "enum" keyword directly inside a namespace or class,All of the above
19,Which of the following statements are in-correct?,A catch block is always preceded by the try block,The main purpose of the catch block is to handle the exception raised in the try block,Catch block is only going to execute when the exception is raised in the program,In C# you can use more than one catch block with the try block,In C# multiple catch block is used to handle different types of exceptions,In C# you can use multiple catch blocks for the same type of exception
20,An exception is an error that happens at runtime. Exception handling automates much of the error handling code. C# defines standard exceptions for common program errors. Which of the following is not a C# standard exception?,DivideByZeroException: It comes when the user tries to division an integer value by zero,IndexOutOfRangeException: When an array index is out-of-bounds,InvalidCastException: A runtime cast is invalid,OutOfMemoryException: Insufficient free memory exists to continue program execution,OverflowException: An arithmetic overflow occurred,None of the above
